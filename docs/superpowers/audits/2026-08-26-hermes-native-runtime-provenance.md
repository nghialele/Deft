# Hermes native runtime provenance

**Date:** 2026-08-26
**Scope:** Development pin for the native integration bundle. The release gate
must independently reproduce this pin from a clean upstream checkout.

```text
distribution: hermes-agent
version: 0.20.5
repository: https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent.git
ref: refs/tags/v2026.8.19
commit: fcbd1076a93841fa88855acce810e342a5b78101
```

The local audited profile reported Hermes `0.20.5` / `2026.8.19`, and the tag
resolved to the commit above. Its profile interpreter passed the Deft native
adapter suite 12/12. This record selects the runtime to reproduce; it is not a
substitute for the clean-checkout, commit-bound release certificate.

## Revalidation — 2026-08-27

The same profile interpreter and clean pinned checkout were revalidated after
native recovery hardening:

```text
command: C:\tmp\hermes-venv-fcbd1076\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest integrations.hermes.deft-platform.test_deft_platform -v
result: Ran 24 tests; OK
runtime version: 0.20.5
peeled ref commit: fcbd1076a93841fa88855acce810e342a5b78101
upstream worktree: clean (0 changed or untracked files)
```

This local revalidation remains supporting evidence only. The release workflow
must reproduce the pin and suite from the exact release tag before publication.

## Revalidation — 2026-10-04 (fork, experimental)

Revalidated against the Hermes 0.21.5 release. Recorded pin:

```text
distribution: hermes-agent
version: 0.21.5
repository: https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent.git
ref: refs/tags/v2026.9.24
commit: f97608f178d1ffeca59860195ab7da295f7c8e5f
```

The native adapter suite was run from a clean detached worktree of
`refs/tags/v2026.9.24` (commit `f97608f178d1ffeca59860195ab7da295f7c8e5f`):
27 tests, all passing. The worktree was removed afterward and the host
checkout left clean.

This revalidation is fork evidence, not an upstream certification. The
manifest's compatibility range extends past this tested version and is
marked experimental (`x-fork-experimental: true`); only 0.21.5 within
that range is suite-verified.
